### Why Treble Damages Apply

**N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 allows 3x damages for willful unfair or deceptive conduct:**

1. **Pattern of Broken Promises**
   - Hotel promised → not provided
   - Callbacks promised → not received
   - Credits promised → partially withheld
   - Repairs promised → not completed

2. **Bad Faith Customer Service**
   - 73+ days of case management with zero resolution
   - Repeated transfers between representatives
   - "Approval process" used indefinitely
   - No timeline ever provided

3. **Vendor Confirmation Ignored**
   - A&W Heating confirmed full replacement needed
   - FirstKey offered broken portable heaters instead
   - Knew correct fix but chose inadequate solution

4. **Knowing Child Endangerment**
   - 3-year-old in 57°F home
   - Refused hotel accommodation
   - Offered insufficient temporary solution
   - Continued delays despite child in home

5. **Deliberate Delay Tactics**
   - 5 months on water leak
   - 70+ hours on heating (and counting)
   - No urgency despite emergency conditions
   - "Approval process" excuse without timeline

- $25,000 cash
- Outstanding $477.16 credit paid
