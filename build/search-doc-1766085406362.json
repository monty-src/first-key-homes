The heaters provided were incompatible with the home's electrical system, which caused repeated power outages.  According to FirstKey Homes' own guidance:  For any maintenance emergencies, please call 844-395-3959.— FirstKey Homes Website  We later learned that Jason Page (Work Order 2611839) did not contact us that night because the issue was internally labeled as Urgent rather than Emergency.  That explanation raises two important concerns.  First, even if the initial request was incorrectly classified, the follow-up call (Request 2952205)—made after no contact and with the home still without heat—clearly met the standard of an emergency.  Second, both the FirstKey Homes website and the automated customer service system state that emergencies should be handled exclusively by calling 844-395-3959, while the portal is intended for all other requests. We followed that instruction.  Analysis  After speaking with representatives from the 844 number and with Rachel, it was explained that FirstKey Homes distinguishes between several internal categories: Urgent, Emergency, Follow-Up, Complaint, Issue, and Work Order.  This internal process—and the miscommunication within it—created a critical gap. The result was simple and serious: our home had no heat, and we were forced to remove our daughter from the residence.

The &quot;Approval Process&quot; Black Hole: Every single emergency repair—from the HVAC replacement to the water line fix—was stopped by an internal &quot;approval process.&quot; They never provided a timeline, a deadline, or a contact, trapping me in endless delay while pretending work was pending.Requesting Redundant Work: Even after their own vendor (A&amp;W) confirmed my 24-year-old heating system needed a full replacement, Rachel insisted on getting two quotes. This was a deliberate waste of time that prolonged my family's time in the cold.Demanding Unnecessary Verification: They demanded a specialist come to &quot;test the portable heaters for 15 minutes&quot; to see if they worked. This was an insulting request that minimized the crisis and prolonged my child's exposure to 57 temperatures.Mislabeling My Emergency: I explicitly told representatives like Narvi and Yhen that the situation was a life-or-death emergency due to my 3-year-old being in a cold home with a fire risk. Their internal classification of the issue as merely &quot;Urgent&quot; ensured the repair would be delayed and neglected.

The sheer volume of contact was deliberately chaotic, ensuring no one ever took responsibility.  The Broken Promise Cycle (The Catch-22): Representatives repeatedly made specific promises that were immediately broken. They promised Jason Page would call to fix the electrical issue that night; he never called. They promised Hotel Accommodation for my daughter; they later refused it. I was left stranded based on their lies.The Representative Merry-Go-Round: I spoke to 23 different people over 25 phone calls for the heating issue alone. Every single call required me to start the story over, and every new representative lost the context of the last, preventing any forward movement.The Hotel Promise Lie: The promise of immediate safe housing for my child was the ultimate deception, proving that FirstKey's primary goal was to appear helpful while actively refusing the necessary care.

Deceptive Partial Payment / Withholding Funds: They promised to credit my account $1,161.41 for the excess water charges caused by their faulty line. They only delivered $684.25, and to this day, they have withheld the remaining $477.16 without explanation. This is not a mistake; it is a clear act of financial deception designed to force me to give up the outstanding balance.Improper Cost Shifting (Unjust Enrichment): For five months, I was forced to pay for the excess water and sewer charges caused by the leak on their supply line, costing me over $982.61. They illegally made me pay for their failure to maintain their own property.Incorrect Application of Fees: Even after Mariola Schubbe confirmed my account would not be penalized due to the water issue, they charged me a late fee on my November rent, forcing me to spend more time calling to get it removed.

Ignoring Expert Consensus: Multiple licensed plumbers (Charlotte Plumbing, Swift Bros) confirmed the leak was on the supply line outside the house. Yet, FirstKey employee Kevin Walls contradicted them, suggesting cheaper internal fixes (like a toilet component). This tactic gave them an excuse to ignore the required underground excavation for five months.Non-Accountable Vendor Deployment: They sent an unidentified vendor with an excavator to begin digging on my property without giving me any scope of work, credentials, or a final report. This was purely a performance to make it look like they were working, while yielding zero legal documentation of a resolution.

The Deceptive Hand-Off (False Hope): Local Charlotte staff (like Rachel and Mariola) gave me their personal emails and direct phone numbers, explicitly telling me to bypass the frustrating 844 offshore line. When I used them during emergencies, the emails were often non-existent, and the phone calls went to voicemail or automated systems. This was a dead-end designed to create false hope.Systemic Information Siloing (The Blame Game): The offshore 844 line cannot make outgoing calls; they can only input work orders. When I finally reached someone local, they had no access to the offshore System of Record (SOR). Rachel actually asked me to provide the work order numbers that promised the hotel and Jason Page! I was forced to act as FirstKey's file clerk and re-contextualize the entire crisis because their internal systems are designed to fail.
