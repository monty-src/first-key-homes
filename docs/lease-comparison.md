## **Lease Comparison**

| Term | 2022 Lease ($2,155) | 2023 Lease ($2,365) | 2024 Lease ($2,555) | 2025 Lease ($2,855) | Potential Legal Issue |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Monthly Rent | $2,155.00 | $2,365.00 (9.74% ↑) | $2,555.00 (8.03% ↑) | $2,855.00 (11.74% ↑) | Cumulative ≈32.4% increase over four years.|
| Late Fee | $75.00 | $100.00 | $100.00 | $100.00 | Increased 33% in 2023.|
| NSF Fee | $25.00 | $35.00 | $25.00 | $25.00 | Likely Illegal in 2023: North Carolina law caps the NSF fee at $25.00. The $35.00 fee charged in the 2023 Lease was arguably a breach of state law. |
| Utility Management Fee | "Usage" (No Fee) | "Usage plus $7 Management Cost" | "Usage plus $7 Management Cost" | "Usage plus $0.00 Management Cost" | Improper Surcharge: The $7 monthly fee for utility management (2023/2024 Leases)  |
| Early Termination Fee | $4,310.00 | $4,730.00 | $7,665.00 | $5,710.00 | Major Fluctuation: The 2024 fee is ≈3× the monthly rent. NC law generally allows a maximum of 1.5 months' rent for a year-long lease termination fee. |
| Fireplace Maintenance Clause | (None in snippets) | (None in snippets) | (None in snippets) | Landlord shall not undertake any maintenance work or replacement of any fireplace component (Added in 2025). | New Evasion of Duty: This clause is critical because it appears to be a direct contractual attempt to disclaim liability for the fireplace. |
