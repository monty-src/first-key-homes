# Concerns

## Urgent vs Emergency vs Follow Up vs Complaint

On **December 10**, we experienced an emergency. The heaters provided were incompatible with the home's electrical system, which caused repeated power outages.

According to FirstKey Homes' own guidance:

> *For any maintenance emergencies, please call 844-395-3959.*
> — FirstKey Homes Website

We later learned that **Jason Page (Work Order 2611839)** did not contact us that night because the issue was internally labeled as **Urgent** rather than **Emergency.**

That explanation raises two important concerns.

**First**, even if the initial request was incorrectly classified, the follow-up call (**Request 2952205**)—made after no contact and with the home still without heat—clearly met the standard of an emergency.

**Second**, both the FirstKey Homes website and the automated customer service system state that emergencies should be handled exclusively by calling **844-395-3959**, while the portal is intended for all other requests. We followed that instruction.

**Analysis**

After speaking with representatives from the 844 number and with Rachel, it was explained that FirstKey Homes distinguishes between several internal categories: *Urgent, Emergency, Follow-Up, Complaint, Issue,* and *Work Order.*

This internal process—and the miscommunication within it—created a critical gap. The result was simple and serious: our home had no heat, and we were forced to remove our daughter from the residence.


## Cost-Control vs Habitability

During our Heat Crisis after A & W Cooling determined that a full HVAC replacement was necessary Rachel from FirstKey Homes notified us that another vendor
will be coming to also review the HVAC for a second quote. She said this is required by FirstKey Homes policy before they can approve a replacement.

During the water crisis this was not a concern, but no Heat in December we don't have time to wait for multiple quotes. The home is uninhabitable without heat in December.

**Analysis**

- Portable Heaters are not sufficient to maintain habitability in December
- Customers should not be forced to wait for multiple quotes when habitability is at risk

First Key Homes should accomimodate family with temporary housing if they are unwilling to expedite the HVAC replacement process in winter months.
