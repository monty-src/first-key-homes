# Settlement Offer

:::caution
This letter constitutes **FORMAL FINAL NOTICE** before we initiate legal proceedings. Your company's failure to maintain the property at 3017 Colvard Parkway, Charlotte, NC 28269 in a fit and habitable condition, as required by **N.C. Gen. Stat. § 42-42 (Landlord Duties)**, constitutes a material breach of our lease agreement and the **Implied Warranty of Habitability** under North Carolina law.

Your pattern of neglect over the past five months—specifically regarding the continued failure of the HVAC system and resulting secondary issues—has caused substantial damage, including but not limited to:
:::

### **I. Preliminary Warning and Legal Context**

* **Property Damage and Diminished Use.**
* **Severe disruption to the quiet enjoyment of the premises.**
* **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.**
* **Potential Child Endangerment** due to uninhabitable living temperatures/conditions.

We have exhausted all good-faith attempts to resolve these critical issues. Unless a settlement is reached by the deadline below, we will immediately file a lawsuit seeking all remedies available under North Carolina law, including treble damages.

### **II. Settlement Offer - Primary Demand**

To settle all current and potential claims arising from your breaches, we demand the following comprehensive settlement package.

| Component | Demand Specification | Rationale/Authority |
