# Issue #2: Child Endangerment

I see you are updating the content, and you want me to rewrite the "Child Endangerment" section, specifically incorporating the narrative detail about the decision to stay, the fear of electrical fire, and the frustrating labeling of the issue as "urgent" instead of "emergency."

I will restructure this into a powerful, legally focused section demonstrating willful negligence in the face of known danger to a minor.

Here is the rewritten section for **Issue #2: Child Endangerment**:


This issue stems directly from the failure in Issue \#1, but FirstKey's response to the known presence of a 3-year-old child in an uninhabitable home constitutes a separate and severe act of **willful negligence** and **child endangerment**.

## Exposure and Risk Assessment

FirstKey Homes was explicitly notified that a 3-year-old child was exposed to dangerous indoor temperatures for over 70 hours.

| Hazard Parameter | North Carolina Law (N.C.G.S. § 42-42) | Actual Conditions (70+ Hours) | Risk Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum Legal Heat** | Landlord must maintain capability for **68°F** | **57°F** (11°F below legal minimum) | Clear and persistent legal violation. |
| **Health Risk** | N/A | Prolonged exposure below **60°F poses health risks** (CDC Guidelines) | Significant risk of Hypothermia and Respiratory Illness for a 3-year-old. |
| **Duration** | Emergency Repairs must be **Immediate/Prompt** | **70+ Hours** in dangerous cold (Dec 9 PM - Dec 12 AM) | Gross negligence and failure to uphold emergency duty. |

### The Landlord's Duty to Protect

NC law grants **extra protection** to tenants under the age of 18. FirstKey had an enhanced, non-delegable duty to ensure the home maintained a safe and healthy temperature for the child.

## FirstKey's Knowing Endangerment

The most egregious failure is FirstKey's deliberate choice to categorize this situation as merely **"Urgent"** rather than an **"Emergency"**, directly contradicting the facts provided by the tenants.

### 1. Electrical Fire Hazard Ignored

The parents made the decision to stay overnight based on the immediate promises of support from representatives Narvi and Yhen. The family was then forced to choose between cold exposure and a fire hazard:

* **Explicit Warning:** Narvi and Yhen were clearly informed that the broken portable heaters, if plugged in, **tripped the electrical breaker** and presented a potential **electrical fire hazard**, which could cause more harm than good.
* **The Decision to Freeze:** The family endured the freezing cold rather than risk a fire, demonstrating the severity of the temporary "solution" FirstKey provided.

| Work Order | Representative | Explanation of Emergency (Catch-22) | Promised Solution | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2611839** | Narvi | No heat; provided heaters trip breaker, causing power loss to part of the home (fire risk). | **Jason Page** from FirstKey would call *tonight* to address the electrical/breaker issue. | ❌ **No Call from Jason Page.** The child remained in the dangerous environment. |
| **2952205** | Yhen | Repeated Catch-22; Jason Page never called; freezing cold and need help now. | Charlotte Local Office would contact us with **Hotel Accommodation**. | ❌ **No Call from Local Office. Hotel Accommodation Refused.** |

### 2. Failure to Provide Safe Alternative

Despite multiple opportunities, FirstKey failed its duty to provide a safe alternative for the child, directly leading to the family's separation.

* **Refusal of Hotel:** The promised hotel accommodation was never delivered, and later, representative Rachel actively **refused** accommodation, instructing the family to seek assistance through their **Renter's Insurance**.
* **Forced Removal:** The parents were ultimately forced to remove the 3-year-old from the home due to the sustained, dangerous temperatures and FirstKey's complete failure to act.

## Impact and Consequences

### Physical Dangers

* **Risk of Illness:** Exposure to 57°F for days significantly increased the child's risk of respiratory illness.
* **Sleep Disruption:** The child could not sleep comfortably, leading to physical and emotional stress.
* **Forced Removal:** The child was displaced from her home and separated from her parents during a critical time (the holiday season) due to the landlord's negligence.

### Emotional and Psychological Impact

* **Trauma:** The 3-year-old child was subjected to prolonged psychological stress, repeatedly asking, "Why is our house so cold?"
* **Displacement:** Family separation and the destruction of holiday traditions cause significant emotional injury to a child of this age.

**Conclusion:** FirstKey Homes' decision to label a 57°F house with a tripping electrical breaker (fire risk) and a child inside as "urgent" instead of "emergency," and subsequently breaking promises for accommodation, demonstrates a complete and reckless disregard for the child's life and safety. This is a primary factor supporting a claim for **Treble Damages** under the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act.

## Takeaways

FirstKey Homes' response to this heating failure demonstrates a **reckless disregard for the safety of a minor** residing in the property.

* **Willful Endangerment:** FirstKey was explicitly informed of the 3-year-old child's presence, the life-threatening internal temperature 57°F, and the fire hazard posed by their temporary solution (tripping electrical breakers).
* **Failed Duty of Care:** The repeated classification of the situation as merely **"Urgent"** instead of an **"Emergency"** by the Charlotte Local Office is a demonstrable failure to meet the required legal standard of care for a minor.
* **Breach of Promise:** The broken promise of immediate hotel accommodation, coupled with the instruction to rely on Renter's Insurance, confirms that FirstKey prioritized **cost avoidance** over the immediate health and safety of the child.
* **Forced Separation:** FirstKey's negligence directly resulted in the **forced removal and displacement** of the 3-year-old child from her home, causing unnecessary trauma and disrupting family life during the critical holiday season.
