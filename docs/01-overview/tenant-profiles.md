- Delayed healing from any illness

**Emotional/Psychological:**

- Holiday season disrupted
- Question: "Why is our house so cold?" (unsafe environment question)

**Social:**

- Missed playdates, activities
- Disrupted routines
- Separation from family (child removed)
- Holiday traditions canceled

### Jury Impact

**Extremely Sympathetic:**

- ✅ Innocent 3-year-old endangered

## Jury Sympathy Analysis

### Why Jury Will Sympathize

1. **Perfect Tenants**: Never late, responsible, professional
2. **Professional People**: SVP and engineer (educated, credible)
3. **Child in Home**: 3-year-old endangered (most sympathetic element)
4. **Clear Bad Faith**: Multiple broken promises
5. **Vendor Evidence**: Landlord knew what fix was needed
6. **Emergency Situation**: Winter heating (life-threatening)
7. **Perfect Case**: No defense available to landlord
8. **David vs. Goliath**: Individuals vs. property management company
9. **Holiday Timing**: Child removed from home during holidays
10. **Ongoing**: Still unresolved as of trial

### Jury Questions

- "How could FirstKey leave a 3-year-old in a 57°F house?"
- "Why would they offer broken heaters instead of fixing the heat?"
- "How is it okay to promise hotel and then not deliver?"
- "Why didn't they fix the water leak in 5 months?"
- "What kind of company treats good tenants like this?"

**All questions lead to one answer: FirstKey is liable and should pay.**

---

## Takeaway

The **combination of profiles** creates a compelling case:

- **Tenants**: Perfect, professional, responsible, sympathetic
- **Landlord**: Negligent, bad faith, dismissive of problems
- **Situation**: Emergency with child endangerment
- **Outcome**: Tenant credibility vs. landlord negligence

**Jury will side with tenants 9 out of 10 times.**
