### **Problem Statement**

Since the date July 1, 2025 the water utilities were transferred into the our name, the monthly water usage at the property increased dramatically and abnormally. Multiple First Key Homes representatives and several vendors have inspected the home, each one confirming evidence of a **water leak on the property's supply line**. Despite these confirmations, the issue has not been fully resolved, and we have incurred significant financial impact due to elevated water bills.

:::caution
Under **North Carolina landlord-tenant law (N.C.G.S. § 42-42(a)(2))**, the landlord must:

> **"Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition."**

A prolonged underground waterline leak is a **habitability and maintenance issue**, and failure to fix it promptly shifts financial burden unlawfully to us.
:::

**We need the following:**

1. **Written confirmation from a licensed plumber** that the leak is fully resolved, including the location and method of repair.
2. **A full correction and concession** of all excessive water charges resulting from the unresolved leak.
3. **Status update on the remaining credit balance** owed by First Key Homes.

## **Water Bills**

* **Average bill before July 1, 2025:** **$54.75/month**
* **Bills after leak detection period:**
  * July 1–Aug 8: **$372.74**
  * Aug 8–Sept 8: **$219.37**
  * Subsequent months continue to show elevated use

This represents increases as high as **291% month-over-month**.

### **3. Outstanding Credit Payment**

Confirm when the remaining **$477.16** credit will be applied to the tenant’s account.

:::danger **Expenditures**

- Per **Mariola Schubbe** we was suppose to be credited `$1,161.41` towards our rent for the water leak issue. We have only received `$684.25` to date.
- Per **Mariola Schubbe** we was suppose to have no late fees charged due to the water leak issue. We was charged a late fee on our November rent. This issue was resolved after contacting **Hazel Aying**.

## The Crisis in Numbers

### Utility Bills - 580% Increase

**Monthly Water Bill History:**

| Month | Amount | Change | Excess | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Pre-July Average | $54.75 | — | $0 | Normal |
| **July 2025** | **$372.74** | **+580%** | **$317.99** | 🚨 SPIKE |
| August 2025 | $219.37 | -41% | $164.62 | Still High |
| Sept-Dec (est) | ~$150/mo | Declining | $500+ | Leak Unresolved |
| **5-Month Total** | — | — | **$982.61+** | Excess |

### Credit Issues

**FirstKey's Promise vs. Reality:**

| Date Promised | Oct 30, 2025 | Partial Nov | Still Owed |

```
Total Excess Water Charges: $982.61
Less: Credit Received: ($684.25)
─────────────────────────
Still Owed by FirstKey: $477.16

Plus: Estimated unpaid months
      (Sept-Dec): ~$500
─────────────────────────
Total Financial Impact: ~$1,500+
```

### Impact Beyond Money

## FirstKey's Failed Response

### Service Calls

| Call # | Date | Action Taken | Result | Notes |
|--------|------|------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | July | Initial diagnosis | ❌ Not fixed | Problem identified |
| 2 | Aug | Follow-up visit | ❌ Not fixed | Continued bills |
| 3 | Sept | Another attempt | ❌ Not fixed | Pattern emerges |

**Result: Multiple service calls, ZERO repairs**

### Broken Promises

| Leak repair timeline | Never provided | ❌ Still unresolved |

## Legal Violations

### N.C.G.S. § 42-42 - Implied Warranty of Habitability

**The Law:**
> "A landlord shall provide fit premises and shall make all repairs necessary to keep the premises fit and habitable."

**FirstKey's Violation:**
- Failed to maintain functional plumbing for 5+ months
- Leak makes property not reasonably suited for occupancy
- Essential service (water) affected by poor maintenance

**Tenant Remedies:**
- Withhold rent until repair
- Terminate lease
- Sue for damages and rent abatement

### N.C.G.S. § 42-38 - Landlord Duty to Maintain

**The Law:**
> "A landlord shall keep and maintain in good working order and promptly repair all electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other equipment."

**FirstKey's Violation:**
- Failed to keep plumbing in good working order
- Did NOT make prompt repairs
- 5+ months is unreasonably delayed
- Multiple service calls show they knew of problem

### N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 - Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices

**The Law:**
> "Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices... are unlawful."

**FirstKey's Violations:**
- **False Promise**: Promised $1,161.41 credit
- **Deceptive Action**: Only paid $684.25 with no explanation
- **Pattern**: Multiple broken communications about repairs
- **Remedy**: **Treble (3x) damages available**

### Breach of Contract

The lease requires:
- "Premises maintained in habitable condition"
- "All utilities in working order"
- FirstKey violated these express terms

### Unjust Enrichment

FirstKey:
- Allowed leak to continue while collecting rent
- Tenant paid for water caused by landlord's negligence
- FirstKey owes refund of excess charges ($982.61)
- Must pay promised credit ($477.16)

---

## Impact on Tenants

### Financial Stress

**Month by Month Anxiety:**
- July: "Why is bill $372? What's happening?"
- August: "Bill still high! Is leak getting worse?"
- September: "No fix yet? How many months will this last?"
- October: "Promised credit finally! But not full amount."
- November: "Still waiting for rest of credit..."
- December: "Now heating's broken too. This is too much."

### Time and Effort

- **Dozens of phone calls**: To FirstKey representatives
- **Multiple emails**: Requesting updates and explaining situation
- **Research time**: Looking up tenant rights
- **Emotional labor**: Managing stress of ongoing issue
- **Estimated hours**: 15-20+ hours spent on water leak alone

### Loss of Trust

- Can't trust FirstKey to keep promises
- Doesn't believe repairs will actually happen
- Fears of additional hidden problems
- Worry about whether full credit will ever be paid
- Anxiety about future property maintenance

### Physical/Health Impact

- **Sleep disruption**: Worrying about bills
- **Stress symptoms**: Tension, headaches
- **Relationship strain**: Ongoing home issues create tension
- **Mental health**: Anxiety about financial obligations

## Damages Calculation

### Water Leak-Specific Damages

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Excess Bills<br/>$982.61"] --> B["Outstanding Credit<br/>$477.16"]
    B --> C["Rent Abatement<br/>$4,282.50"]
    C --> D["Total Water<br/>$5,742.27"]
```

### Breakdown

1. **Excess Water Charges**: $982.61
   - What tenants paid vs normal bills

2. **Outstanding Credit**: $477.16
   - Still owed by FirstKey

3. **Rent Abatement (6 months @ 25%)**: $4,282.50
   - Premises partially unhabitable due to water issues
   - Justifies 25% rent reduction for 6 months

**Water Issue Total Damages: $5,742.27**

### Why Rent Abatement Applies

North Carolina law allows rent abatement when:
- Landlord fails to maintain habitable conditions
- Defect materially affects use and enjoyment
- Tenant provided notice and landlord failed to repair

**Water leak qualifies:**
- ✅ 5+ months without repair = failure
- ✅ High bills and water issues = material defect
- ✅ Multiple notices given = landlord knowledge
- ✅ Repeated non-performance = landlord failure to remedy

### Treble Damages for Unfair Practices

Under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1:
- **Base damages**: $5,742.27
- **Treble multiplier**: × 3
- **Total treble available**: $17,226.81

**Justification for treble:**
- Deliberately withheld promised credit ($1,161 promised, $684 paid)
- Pattern of broken promises about repairs
- Used "approval process" as delay tactic
- No reasonable explanation for credit shortfall
- 5+ months shows willful neglect

---

## Current Status

**As of December 11, 2025:**

- ❌ Leak: STILL NOT FIXED (5+ months)
- ❌ Outstanding credit: STILL NOT PAID ($477.16)
- ❌ Repair timeline: NEVER PROVIDED
- ❌ Explanation for shortfall: NEVER GIVEN
- ✅ Documentation: COMPLETE
- ✅ Case for damages: STRONG

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Final Demand Letter**
   - Cite water leak as continuing violation
   - Demand $477.16 outstanding credit
   - Include in settlement demand

2. **Prepare Evidence**
   - Organize water bills
   - Compile communication log
   - Back up all documentation

### If Settlement Rejected

1. **Include in Lawsuit**
   - Water damages as part of larger case
   - Include treble damages claim
   - Reference all broken promises

2. **File Code Enforcement Complaint**
   - Plumbing code violations
   - Landlord failure to maintain
   - Request inspection and citations

---

## Takeaway

The water leak demonstrates FirstKey's **pattern of failure**:

- **5+ months** without resolving essential service
- **Multiple service calls** with no results
- **Broken promise** regarding credit ($1,161 promised, $684 paid)
- **No timeline** ever provided for fix
- **No explanation** for credit shortfall

This pattern, combined with the heating emergency, shows a property management company that:
- Makes promises without intention to keep them
- Uses delays as a tactic
- Avoids direct communication about problems
- Places tenant cost burden on tenants rather than fixing issues

**This strengthens the case for treble damages under the Unfair Trade Practices Act.**
