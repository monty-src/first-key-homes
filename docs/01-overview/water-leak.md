## Legal Violations

### N.C.G.S. § 42-42 - Implied Warranty of Habitability

**The Law:**
> "A landlord shall provide fit premises and shall make all repairs necessary to keep the premises fit and habitable."

**FirstKey's Violation:**
- Failed to maintain functional plumbing for 5+ months
- Leak makes property not reasonably suited for occupancy
- Essential service (water) affected by poor maintenance

**Tenant Remedies:**
- Withhold rent until repair
- Terminate lease
- Sue for damages and rent abatement

### N.C.G.S. § 42-38 - Landlord Duty to Maintain

**The Law:**
> "A landlord shall keep and maintain in good working order and promptly repair all electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other equipment."

**FirstKey's Violation:**
- Failed to keep plumbing in good working order
- Did NOT make prompt repairs
- 5+ months is unreasonably delayed
- Multiple service calls show they knew of problem

### N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 - Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices

**The Law:**
> "Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices... are unlawful."

**FirstKey's Violations:**
- **False Promise**: Promised $1,161.41 credit
- **Deceptive Action**: Only paid $684.25 with no explanation
- **Pattern**: Multiple broken communications about repairs
- **Remedy**: **Treble (3x) damages available**

### Breach of Contract

The lease requires:
- "Premises maintained in habitable condition"
- "All utilities in working order"
- FirstKey violated these express terms

### Unjust Enrichment

FirstKey:
- Allowed leak to continue while collecting rent
- Tenant paid for water caused by landlord's negligence
- FirstKey owes refund of excess charges ($982.61)
- Must pay promised credit ($477.16)

## Impact on Tenants

### Financial Stress

**Month by Month Anxiety:**
- July: "Why is bill $372? What's happening?"
- August: "Bill still high! Is leak getting worse?"
- September: "No fix yet? How many months will this last?"
- October: "Promised credit finally! But not full amount."
- November: "Still waiting for rest of credit..."
- December: "Now heating's broken too. This is too much."

### Time and Effort

- **Dozens of phone calls**: To FirstKey representatives
- **Multiple emails**: Requesting updates and explaining situation
- **Research time**: Looking up tenant rights
- **Emotional labor**: Managing stress of ongoing issue
- **Estimated hours**: 15-20+ hours spent on water leak alone

### Loss of Trust

- Can't trust FirstKey to keep promises
- Doesn't believe repairs will actually happen
- Fears of additional hidden problems
- Worry about whether full credit will ever be paid
- Anxiety about future property maintenance

### Physical/Health Impact

- **Sleep disruption**: Worrying about bills
- **Stress symptoms**: Tension, headaches
- **Relationship strain**: Ongoing home issues create tension
- **Mental health**: Anxiety about financial obligations

## Damages Calculation

### Water Leak-Specific Damages

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Excess Bills<br/>$982.61"] --> B["Outstanding Credit<br/>$477.16"]
    B --> C["Rent Abatement<br/>$4,282.50"]
    C --> D["Total Water<br/>$5,742.27"]
```

### Breakdown

1. **Excess Water Charges**: $982.61
   - What tenants paid vs normal bills

2. **Outstanding Credit**: $477.16
   - Still owed by FirstKey

3. **Rent Abatement (6 months @ 25%)**: $4,282.50
   - Premises partially unhabitable due to water issues
   - Justifies 25% rent reduction for 6 months

**Water Issue Total Damages: $5,742.27**

### Why Rent Abatement Applies

North Carolina law allows rent abatement when:
- Landlord fails to maintain habitable conditions
- Defect materially affects use and enjoyment
- Tenant provided notice and landlord failed to repair

**Water leak qualifies:**
- ✅ 5+ months without repair = failure
- ✅ High bills and water issues = material defect
- ✅ Multiple notices given = landlord knowledge
- ✅ Repeated non-performance = landlord failure to remedy

### Treble Damages for Unfair Practices

Under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1:
- **Base damages**: $5,742.27
- **Treble multiplier**: × 3
- **Total treble available**: $17,226.81

**Justification for treble:**
- Deliberately withheld promised credit ($1,161 promised, $684 paid)
- Pattern of broken promises about repairs
- Used "approval process" as delay tactic
- No reasonable explanation for credit shortfall
- 5+ months shows willful neglect

---

## Current Status

**As of December 11, 2025:**

- ❌ Leak: STILL NOT FIXED (5+ months)
- ❌ Outstanding credit: STILL NOT PAID ($477.16)
- ❌ Repair timeline: NEVER PROVIDED
- ❌ Explanation for shortfall: NEVER GIVEN
- ✅ Documentation: COMPLETE
- ✅ Case for damages: STRONG

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Final Demand Letter**
   - Cite water leak as continuing violation
   - Demand $477.16 outstanding credit
   - Include in settlement demand

2. **Prepare Evidence**
   - Organize water bills
   - Compile communication log
   - Back up all documentation

### If Settlement Rejected

1. **Include in Lawsuit**
   - Water damages as part of larger case
   - Include treble damages claim
   - Reference all broken promises

2. **File Code Enforcement Complaint**
   - Plumbing code violations
   - Landlord failure to maintain
   - Request inspection and citations

---

## Takeaway

The water leak demonstrates FirstKey's **pattern of failure**:

- **5+ months** without resolving essential service
- **Multiple service calls** with no results
- **Broken promise** regarding credit ($1,161 promised, $684 paid)
- **No timeline** ever provided for fix
- **No explanation** for credit shortfall

This pattern, combined with the heating emergency, shows a property management company that:
- Makes promises without intention to keep them
- Uses delays as a tactic
- Avoids direct communication about problems
- Places tenant cost burden on tenants rather than fixing issues

**This strengthens the case for treble damages under the Unfair Trade Practices Act.**
