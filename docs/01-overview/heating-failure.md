# Issue #1: Heating System Failure

## Legal Violations

### N.C.G.S. § 42-42 - Implied Warranty of Habitability

**The Law:**

> "A landlord shall provide fit premises... capable of being heated to 68°F"

**FirstKey's Violation:**

- Failed to maintain heating system
- 57°F = NOT FIT for habitation
- NOT capable of 68°F requirement
- Landlord must ensure basic warmth

**For Child:**

- Extra protection for tenant under 18
- Landlord had duty to ensure safe temperature for child
- 24 hours in 57°F = breach of duty

### N.C.G.S. § 42-38 - Landlord Duty to Maintain

**The Law:**

> "A landlord shall keep and maintain in good working order and promptly repair all... heating... and other equipment."

**FirstKey's Violations:**

- Failed to keep heating working
- Did NOT promptly repair (70+ hours)
- 24-year-old system needed replacement
- Offered inadequate temporary solution
- No timeline for replacement

#### Emergency Repair Standard

**NC law provides:**

- Landlords must make emergency repairs immediately
- Lack of heating in winter = emergency
- 70+ hours = clearly not promptly
- Broken portable heaters = not adequate solution
- Vendor confirmed replacement needed = landlord knows correct fix

### N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 - Unfair and Deceptive Practices

**FirstKey's Violations:**

- **False promises**: Hotel, callbacks, repairs
- **Inadequate response**: Offered broken heaters as solution
- **Ignored vendor report**: Knew replacement needed, offered temporary fix
- **Delay tactics**: "Approval process" without timeline
- **Knowing endangerment**: Continued delay despite child in home

#### Child Endangerment

- Knowingly allowed child in 57°F home
- Refused safe alternative (hotel)
- Offered insufficient temporary solution
- Delayed emergency repair
- Prioritized "approval process" over child safety

## NC Building Code Violations

**Section 602.3 - Heating Systems:**

- Must be capable of maintaining 68°F during winter
- 57°F = clear violation
- Landlord must ensure compliance

**Section 605.1 - Electrical:**

- Must handle normal operation of appliances
- Breaker constantly tripping = hazard
- Fire risk from overloaded circuits

### Charlotte-Mecklenburg Specific

**Local Heating Requirements:**

- Minimum 68°F capability required
- Must be maintained by landlord
- Repairs must be prompt
- Emergency repairs = immediate


## Visits & Communications: The FirstKey Runaround

FirstKey Homes has used a strategy of **high-volume, low-quality customer service** to delay the emergency repair. This has resulted in a chaotic communication log, numerous broken promises, and conflicting information, making it impossible to secure a timely resolution.

* **Total Contacts:** **25 Calls** made to FirstKey Homes.
* **Total Representatives:** Spoke to **23 different people**, ensuring no single representative ever took ownership of the emergency.

The core issue is that critical, life-threatening information about the 3-year-old child's safety was consistently ignored or downplayed in FirstKey's "System of Record."

### Downplaying an Emergency

Despite clear statements that the lack of heat was an emergency due to a child in the home, FirstKey representatives repeatedly failed to escalate the issue or record the urgency appropriately.

> **Crucial Detail Ignored:** When informed the temperature was in the **50s** and the utility issue was linked to the non-working heating system, representatives like Narvi and Yhen failed to treat this as the emergency it was.

FirstKey's response was to infer the tenants were lying and demand further unnecessary verification:

* **Refused Solution:** A representative (Rachel) proposed sending a specialist to **"test the portable heaters for 15 minutes"** as an "acceptable solution" until the main repair was solved.
* **Tenant Response:** This unacceptable offer was **Refused**. Testing broken heaters while a child is in dangerous cold conditions is negligence.

### Pattern of Broken Promises (Work Orders)

The communication chain is marked by representatives promising immediate action, only to be contradicted or ignored by the next representative or internal office.

| Work Order | Representative | Explanation of Emergency (Catch-22) | Promised Solution | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2611839** | Narvi | No heat; provided heaters trip breaker, causing power loss to part of the home. | **Jason Page** from FirstKey would call *tonight* to address the electrical/breaker issue. | ❌ **No Call from Jason Page.** |
| **2952205** | Yhen | Repeated Catch-22; Jason Page never called; cold and need help now. | Charlotte Local Office would contact us with **Hotel Accommodation**. | ❌ **No Call from Local Office. Hotel Accommodation Refused.** |

### Timeline of Delays and Disregard

FirstKey actively delayed the required full replacement of the 24-year-old system (a necessity confirmed by their own vendor) by insisting on non-solutions.

| Timeframe | FirstKey Action/Representative | Resulting Delay/Violation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vendor (A&W) Report** | Confirmed **FULL REPLACEMENT REQUIRED** on 24-year-old, obsolete system. | FirstKey put the replacement on hold for "approval" and continued to seek temporary fixes. |
| **Rachel (Rep)** | Stated the "process is to get two quotes" and attempted to send a *second* specialist, Benchmark. | Deliberately wasted time knowing the original vendor confirmed replacement was the only fix. |
|  **Rachel (Rep) 2**  | Repeatedly stated tenants should use their **Renter's Insurance** for emergency accommodation. | Directly violated the landlord's duty to provide habitable premises and immediate emergency repair. |
| **Benchmark (Vendor)** | Checked the HVAC and left, suggesting the tenants use the fireplace heater. | Offered a dangerous solution for a home with a 3-year-old and provided no actual repair. |

### Vendor Assessment Ignored

The failure of the HVAC system was confirmed by **FirstKey's own initial vendor**, which removes all doubt regarding the scope of the required fix. FirstKey's continued insistence on temporary measures over 70+ hours is a willful choice to endanger the tenants.

| Vendor (A&W Heating and Cooling) Findings | FirstKey's Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System Manufactured:** 2001 (24 years old) | Attempted to find obsolete replacement parts. |
| **Parts Availability:** Extremely difficult to locate (obsolete). | Insisted on second quotes and "testing" temporary heaters. |
| **Verdict:** **FULL REPLACEMENT REQUIRED.** | **Awaiting FirstKey "approval"** with **No Timeline Provided.** |

## Impact

### Bad Faith Business

- **False Hope**: Promises with no intention to keep them
- **Runaround**: Transfer between reps with no resolution
- **Delays**: "Approval process" without timeline
- **Inadequate Solutions**: Broken heaters offered as real fix
- **Lack of Urgency**: Casual approach to child endangerment

### Physical Dangers

- **Cold Exposure**: 70+ hours at 57°F (11-15°F below safe)
- **Hypothermia Risk**: Prolonged cold can cause symptoms
- **Respiratory Risk**: Winter cold + indoor chill = illness risk
- **Sleep Disruption**: Cannot sleep comfortably at 57°F
- **Play Disruption**: Child cannot play normally in cold

### Behavioral Impact

**From Parents' Observations:**

- Asking repeatedly: "Why is our house so cold?"
- Wearing **winter coat indoors** (abnormal)
- Sleeping under **multiple blankets** (stressed)
- Cannot play or move freely
- Mood affected by constant discomfort

### Health Concerns

**CDC Guidelines on Cold Exposure:**

- Prolonged exposure at 57°F poses health risks to young children
- Respiratory illness more likely in cold homes
- Sleep quality impaired
- Stress hormones elevated from prolonged cold
- Vulnerability increases with age (3 is very young)

### Family Separation

**Decision Made: Child had to be removed from home**

- **Current Status**: Away from siblings' home
- **Duration**: Unknown (depends on repairs)
- **Family Separation**: During holiday season
- **Emotional Impact**: Holiday traditions destroyed
- **Logistics**: Arranging emergency childcare
- **Cost**: Emergency housing/childcare expenses

### Career Context

- **Recent Promotion**: Senior Vice President (within months)
- **Critical Period**: First weeks/months crucial for credibility
- **Role Requirements**: High visibility, in-office presence, leadership
- **Timing**: Worst possible time for forced absences
- **SVP Compensation**: Often includes performance bonuses
- **Visibility Tied to Bonus**: New role requires visibility
- **Forced Absences**: Damage visibility metrics
- **Career Advancement**: Critical transition period disrupted


## Current Status

**As of December 12, 2025:**

- **Heat:** STILL NOT FIXED (70+ hours)
- **Temporary solution:** INADEQUATE (broken heaters)
- **Repair timeline:** NEVER PROVIDED
- **HVAC replacement:** PENDING FirstKey "approval"

## Takeaways

The heating failure demonstrates FirstKey's **complete disregard for tenant safety**:

- **Emergency ignored**: 70+ hours without heat in winter
- **Child endangered**: 3-year-old in 57°F home
- **Solution inadequate**: Broken heaters offered instead of real fix
- **Promises broken**: Hotel, callbacks, repairs all unfulfilled
- **Delays inexplicable**: "Approval process" while family suffers
- **Vendor ignored**: Knew replacement needed but offered temporary fix

Combined with the 5-month water leak, this shows a pattern of:

- Systematic neglect
- Bad faith customer service
- Prioritizing cost over tenant safety
- Making promises to buy time while doing nothing
- Knowing the correct fix but avoiding it

**This justifies treble damages under NC's Unfair Trade Practices Act.**
