# Issue #4: Bad Faith and Systemic Deception

## Deceptive Delay Tactics: The Black Hole

FirstKey's primary strategy for both the heating and water issues was to ensure the repair never started promptly, despite knowing a child was in danger.

* **The "Approval Process" Black Hole:** Every single emergency repair—from the HVAC replacement to the water line fix—was stopped by an internal **"approval process."** They never provided a timeline, a deadline, or a contact, trapping me in endless delay while pretending work was pending.
* **Requesting Redundant Work:** Even after their own vendor (A&W) confirmed my 24-year-old heating system needed a **full replacement**, Rachel insisted on getting **two quotes**. This was a deliberate waste of time that prolonged my family's time in the cold.
* **Demanding Unnecessary Verification:** They demanded a specialist come to **"test the portable heaters for 15 minutes"** to see if they worked. This was an insulting request that minimized the crisis and prolonged my child's exposure to 57 temperatures.
* **Mislabeling My Emergency:** I explicitly told representatives like Narvi and Yhen that the situation was a **life-or-death emergency** due to my 3-year-old being in a cold home with a fire risk. Their internal classification of the issue as merely **"Urgent"** ensured the repair would be delayed and neglected.

## Broken Promises & The Representative Runaround

I spent dozens of hours battling a system designed to frustrate me. The sheer volume of contact was deliberately chaotic, ensuring no one ever took responsibility.

* **The Broken Promise Cycle (The Catch-22):** Representatives repeatedly made specific promises that were immediately broken. They promised **Jason Page** would call to fix the electrical issue that night; **he never called**. They promised **Hotel Accommodation** for my daughter; they later **refused it**. I was left stranded based on their lies.
* **The Representative Merry-Go-Round:** I spoke to **23 different people** over **25 phone calls** for the heating issue alone. Every single call required me to start the story over, and every new representative lost the context of the last, preventing any forward movement.
* **The Hotel Promise Lie:** The promise of immediate safe housing for my child was the ultimate deception, proving that FirstKey's primary goal was to appear helpful while actively refusing the necessary care.

## Financial Bad Faith & Deceptive Accounting

FirstKey actively manipulated my finances, forcing me to bear the costs of their negligence while withholding money they legally owed me.

* **Deceptive Partial Payment / Withholding Funds:** They promised to credit my account \$1,161.41 for the excess water charges caused by their faulty line. They only delivered \$684.25, and to this day, they have withheld the remaining **\$477.16** without explanation. This is not a mistake; it is a clear act of financial deception designed to force me to give up the outstanding balance.
* **Improper Cost Shifting (Unjust Enrichment):** For five months, I was forced to pay for the excess water and sewer charges caused by the leak on their supply line, costing me over \$982.61. They illegally made me pay for their failure to maintain their own property.
* **Incorrect Application of Fees:** Even after Mariola Schubbe confirmed my account would not be penalized due to the water issue, they charged me a **late fee** on my November rent, forcing me to spend more time calling to get it removed.

## Creating and Ignoring Conflicting Information

FirstKey actively sabotaged the repair process for the water leak to delay the expensive fix and confuse the documentation.

* **Ignoring Expert Consensus:** Multiple licensed plumbers (**Charlotte Plumbing, Swift Bros**) confirmed the leak was on the supply line **outside** the house. Yet, FirstKey employee **Kevin Walls** contradicted them, suggesting cheaper internal fixes (like a toilet component). This tactic gave them an excuse to ignore the required underground excavation for five months.
* **Non-Accountable Vendor Deployment:** They sent an **unidentified vendor with an excavator** to begin digging on my property without giving me any scope of work, credentials, or a final report. This was purely a performance to make it look like they were working, while yielding **zero legal documentation** of a resolution.

## Creating False Local Authority & Dead-End Escalation

The customer service system is deliberately rigged to break down and place the entire burden of resolution back on me.

* **The Deceptive Hand-Off (False Hope):** Local Charlotte staff (like Rachel and Mariola) gave me their **personal emails and direct phone numbers**, explicitly telling me to bypass the frustrating 844 offshore line. When I used them during emergencies, the emails were often non-existent, and the phone calls went to **voicemail or automated systems**. This was a dead-end designed to create false hope.
* **Systemic Information Siloing (The Blame Game):** The offshore 844 line cannot make outgoing calls; they can only input work orders. When I finally reached someone local, they had **no access to the offshore System of Record (SOR)**. Rachel actually asked me to provide the work order numbers that promised the hotel and Jason Page! **I was forced to act as FirstKey's file clerk and re-contextualize the entire crisis because their internal systems are designed to fail.**

## Takeaway: The Pattern of Unfair Trade Practices

FirstKey's conduct is not an accident; it is a strategy. Their actions—from endangering my child in a 57 home to actively **withholding promised funds**—are unethical, oppressive, and substantially injurious. This clear, consistent pattern across both the heating and water issues is the definitive proof required for a finding of **Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices** and the award of **Treble Damages.**
