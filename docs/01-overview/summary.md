## Impact on Tenants

### Financial Stress

**Month by Month Anxiety:**
- July: "Why is bill $372? What's happening?"
- August: "Bill still high! Is leak getting worse?"
- September: "No fix yet? How many months will this last?"
- October: "Promised credit finally! But not full amount."
- November: "Still waiting for rest of credit..."
- December: "Now heating's broken too. This is too much."

### Time and Effort

- **Dozens of phone calls**: To FirstKey representatives
- **Multiple emails**: Requesting updates and explaining situation

- Fears of additional hidden problems
- Worry about whether full credit will ever be paid
- Anxiety about future property maintenance

### Physical/Health Impact
