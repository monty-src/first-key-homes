# Executive Summary

## Case Overview

FirstKey Homes has violated North Carolina tenant habitability laws through systematic failures to maintain essential services over a 5-month period, resulting in:

1. **Water Leak Crisis** (July-December 2025): Unresolved leak causing 580% utility bill increases
2. **Heating System Failure** (December 9-present): Complete HVAC failure with indoor temperatures at 57°F in winter
3. **Pattern of Bad Faith**: Multiple broken promises regarding repairs, credits, and temporary accommodations
4. **Child Endangerment**: 3-year-old child forced to live in uninhabitable conditions

## Tenant Profile

- **Montez Byrd**: Senior Vice President, Bank of America
- **Nia Tara Byrd**: Software Engineer
- **Tenancy Duration**: 3 years (since 2022)
- **Payment History**: Perfect (never late)
- **Monthly Rent**: $2,855
- **Child**: 3-year-old daughter

### Why This Matters for the Case

Perfect payment history and professional credibility make these tenants highly sympathetic to a jury. An SVP at Bank of America cannot easily explain forced absences to leadership. The involvement of a young child makes FirstKey's conduct appear callous and dangerous.

### Why Treble Damages Apply

**N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 allows 3x damages for willful unfair or deceptive conduct:**

1. **Pattern of Broken Promises**
   - Hotel promised → not provided
   - Callbacks promised → not received
   - Credits promised → partially withheld
   - Repairs promised → not completed

2. **Bad Faith Customer Service**
   - 73+ days of case management with zero resolution
   - Repeated transfers between representatives
   - "Approval process" used indefinitely
   - No timeline ever provided

3. **Vendor Confirmation Ignored**
   - A&W Heating confirmed full replacement needed
   - FirstKey offered broken portable heaters instead
   - Knew correct fix but chose inadequate solution

4. **Knowing Child Endangerment**
   - 3-year-old in 57°F home
   - Refused hotel accommodation
   - Offered insufficient temporary solution
   - Continued delays despite child in home

5. **Deliberate Delay Tactics**
   - 5 months on water leak
   - 51+ hours on heating (and counting)
   - No urgency despite emergency conditions
   - "Approval process" excuse without timeline

## Minimum Acceptable Terms

**Will NOT accept less than:**

   - All legal basis explained

2. **Establish rent escrow** (today or tomorrow)

## Conclusion

This is a strong case with clear legal violations, sympathetic tenants, and documented damages exceeding $147,000 with treble damages. FirstKey faces:

- Certain liability in court
- Likely treble damages award
- Attorney fees and court costs
- Regulatory complaints and fines
- Reputational damage
- Potential media coverage

**Settlement at $35,000 is significantly below court exposure and represents strong incentive to resolve before litigation.**
