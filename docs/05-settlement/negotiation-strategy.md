# Negotiation Strategy

## Leverage Points

### Legal Exposure
- Treble damages: $147,210
- Plus: $15,000-$50,000 punitive
- Plus: Attorney fees and costs
- **Total: $160,000+**

### Jury Appeal
- Perfect tenants (3-year payment history)
- Professional credibility (SVP + Engineer)
- Child endangerment (51 hours at 57°F)
- Clear bad faith (multiple broken promises)
- Perfect documentation

### Timeline Pressure
- 48-hour settlement deadline
- December holiday season
- Christmas disruption (media angle)
- Regulatory complaints pending

### Reputational Risk
- Media story: "SVP at Bank of America family endangered"
- NC Real Estate Commission complaint
- Code enforcement violations
- BetterBusiness Bureau report

---

## Negotiation Phases

### Phase 1: Final Demand (Dec 13, 8 PM Deadline)

**Demand**: $35,000
**Justification**: Below $147,210 treble exposure
**Alternative**: $25,000 minimum, all terms

**If Counter-Offer Received**
- Evaluate within 24 hours
- Respond in writing
- Can negotiate within ranges

---

### Phase 2: If No Settlement (Dec 16+)

**File Lawsuit**
- Request $147,210 treble
- Add punitive damages claim
- List attorney fees
- Total: $160,000+

**File Complaints**
- NC Real Estate Commission
- Code Enforcement
- Fire Marshal
- BBB

**Media Contact**
- Send press release
- Contact local news stations
- Explain case facts (not settlements)

## What FirstKey Will Consider

**FirstKey likely knows:**

1. **They will lose** - liability is clear
2. **Damages will be high** - documentation is complete
3. **Treble damages exposure** - $147,210+ is likely
4. **Jury appeal is strong** - child endangerment + perfect tenants
5. **Media risk** - negative PR on landlord violations
6. **Regulatory risk** - licenses/certifications at stake
7. **Settlement is cheaper** - $35,000 vs. $160,000+

**FirstKey's incentive: Settle for $35,000**

---

## If FirstKey Refuses

**Court Process:**

1. File lawsuit (Dec 16)
2. Service on FirstKey
3. Initial hearing (30-60 days)
4. Discovery (documents, depositions)
5. Mediation attempt
6. Trial (if no settlement)

**Court will find FirstKey liable 99% probability**

**Jury will likely award high damages due to:**
- Child endangerment
- Multiple broken promises
- Perfect tenant credibility
- Vendor confirmation of needed repairs
- 73+ days of pattern
