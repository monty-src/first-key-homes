### **Problem Statement**

Since the date July 1, 2025 the water utilities were transferred into the our name, the monthly water usage at the property increased dramatically and abnormally. Multiple First Key Homes representatives and several vendors have inspected the home, each one confirming evidence of a **water leak on the property's supply line**. Despite these confirmations, the issue has not been fully resolved, and we have incurred significant financial impact due to elevated water bills.

:::caution
Under **North Carolina landlord-tenant law (N.C.G.S. § 42-42(a)(2))**, the landlord must:

> **"Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition."**

A prolonged underground waterline leak is a **habitability and maintenance issue**, and failure to fix it promptly shifts financial burden unlawfully to us.
:::

**We need the following:**

1. **Written confirmation from a licensed plumber** that the leak is fully resolved, including the location and method of repair.
2. **A full correction and concession** of all excessive water charges resulting from the unresolved leak.
3. **Status update on the remaining credit balance** owed by First Key Homes.

* **Bills after leak detection period:**
  * July 1–Aug 8: **$372.74**
  * Aug 8–Sept 8: **$219.37**
