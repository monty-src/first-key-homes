# Treble Damages Analysis

## Legal Basis

**N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1** allows **3x damages** for willful unfair or deceptive trade practices.

## FirstKey's Willful Conduct

1. **Deliberate Pattern of Broken Promises**
   - Hotel promised, not provided
   - Callbacks promised, not received
   - Credits promised, partially withheld ($1,161 → $684)

2. **Bad Faith Customer Service**
   - 73 days of runaround with zero resolution
   - Multiple representatives, no coordination
   - "Approval process" used as indefinite delay

3. **Vendor Confirmation Ignored**
   - A&W Heating confirmed full replacement needed
   - FirstKey offered broken portable heaters instead
   - Knew correct fix but chose to delay

4. **Knowing Child Endangerment**
   - 3-year-old in 57°F home for 51+ hours
   - Refused safe alternative (hotel)
   - Offered insufficient temporary solution
   - Continued delays despite child in home

5. **Systematic Delay Tactics**
   - 5 months on water leak with multiple service calls
   - 51+ hours on emergency heating without fix
   - No timeline ever provided
   - Excuses changed repeatedly

## Calculation

- **Actual Damages**: $49,070
- **Treble Multiplier**: × 3
- **Treble Total**: **$147,210**

## Justification for Treble

Courts apply treble damages when conduct is:
- ✅ Willful (intentional bad faith)
- ✅ Deceptive (false promises documented)
- ✅ Pattern-based (73+ days of pattern)
- ✅ Knowing (vendor report proves knowledge)
- ✅ Egregious (child endangerment)

**FirstKey's conduct meets ALL criteria.**
